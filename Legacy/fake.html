            <p>This will be deticated to list the scourge on the internet that are these websites that either use AI to generate answers or steal awnsers from other sources. They all seem to take the form of Q&A sites, and awnsers often seem to be taken out of context. It's easy to find these sites by asking a question in a search engine like an old person would. I will use the rest of this page to document those that i do find.<br>
