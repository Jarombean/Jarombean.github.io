        <h2>FAQ</h2>
        <h4>Why does your page look like absolute garbage?</h4>
        <p>My page looks like garbage because I just started learning html and css, come back in a while and it will look better, I hope.

        <h4>What software do you use to build your page?</h4>
        <p>I used to develop everything in Gedit, but now I use the built-in github editor to do 95% of the work.</p>
        <h4>What Browser do you use?</h4>
        <p>I use Firefox as my primary browser, It's come a long way in the past few years, and the Gecko rendering engine works fine. </p>
        <h4>Will there be any more website after this?</h4>
        <p>Yes, there will be more stuff, eventually it will be interactive in some way.</p>

        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <h3>Cars</h3>
        <img src="../assets/Rx7.jpg" alt="Mazda Rx-7 Seires 8" height="150">
        <p>It's no secret that I love cars, heres a list of my dream cars at some point in time:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Porsche Boxster 986
            <li>Toyota Corolla "AE86"

            <li>Porsche 356 A Speedster
            <li>Chevrolet Corvette C5
        </ul>
        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>History is honestly <strong>super</strong> intersting to me, My favorite subject is the Rhodesian Bush war between 1965 and 1979.</p>
        <img src="../assets/Rhodies.jpg" alt="Rhodesian soldiers on patrol" height="200">
        <p> the subject fascinates me, the idea of such a small country being shunned by the entire international community, warring against soviet-backed forces, and holding out for over a decade blows my mind!</p>
        <h4>What's the Rhodesian Bush war?</h4>
        <p>Rhodesia was a country in southern Africa. First founded in the 1890's by the British, Rhodesia would gain self-governance in 1923. In the 1960's as the british were decololizing, a power vacuum formed. All across Africa, guerilla groups formed to fill the void. PM Ian Smith saw this was happening, and <strong>U</strong>nilateraly <strong>D</strong>eclared <strong>I</strong>ndependence in 1965.<br> This resulted in international condemnation and soviet-backed guerillas marched into Rhodesia to stop the white-rule. Rhodesia held up for 15 years, finally turning over some power to moderate black groups in 1978, and to the soviet guerillas in 1980, Robert Mugabe ruled as a dictator until 2017, when a coup started by his own party overthrew him </p>
        <h3>Politics</h3>
        <img src="../assets/Dripler.jpg" alt="adolf dripler" height="200">
        <p>All jokes aside, I do have actual beliefs about politics. I am a social conservative and an economic populist.
        <br>I Believe the American School of economics would be the best for our country as opposed to our free trade system of today.
        <br> I am a non-interventionist and oppose American intervention overseas. Combined with my policy on trade, I am considered isolationist by some
        <br> For these reasons, I think it's accurate to describe myself as a Paleoconservative.</p>
        <h3>Airplanes</h3>
        <img src="../assets/airplane.jpg" alt="Citaton X" height="150">
        <p>I like watching airplanes, I live near a small airport with lots of air traffic, so I get ample time during the summer months to watch airplanes.<br>These are the most common airplane types in my area:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cessna 172 and similar
            <li>Cessna Citation and similar
            <li>DHC dash 8 / Bombadier Q4000
        </ul>    
        <h3>Computing</h3>
        <img src="../assets/Computer.jpg" alt="Computer" height="150">
        <p>I use Linux on my computer, specificaly Zorin OS. I am an advocate for open-source software. Before this, I used Windows 98, Xp, 7 and 10. I have many fond memories of Windows 7 Especially.<br>I have compiled a list of Alternative software <a href="software.html">here.</a>
            <br>I have started a post <a href=fake.html>here</a> to document a scourge on the internet that is seemingly growing in strength.</p>
