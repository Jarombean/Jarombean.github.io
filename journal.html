            <p>This is the first post in my digital journal, I woke up late. At the technical school, I worked with the guys to replace some sparkplugs. We got the wrong ones.
            After a commute to school, I ate a slice of pizza and went to English class, where I worried that smart homes might be the only option in the future.</p>
